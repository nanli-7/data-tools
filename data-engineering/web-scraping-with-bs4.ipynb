At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do.[1] Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.[2]\n\nAn ideal (perfect) intelligent machine is a flexible agent which perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of success at some goal or objective.[3] As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition.

Researchers are also trying to create creative and emotional AI which can possibly empathize or create art. Many approaches and tools have been tried.\n\nBorrowing from the management literature, Kaplan and Haenlein classify artificial intelligence into three different types of AI systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence.[8] Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence generating cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions. Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive as well as emotional intelligence, understanding, in addition to cognitive elements, also human emotions considering them in their decision making. Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence), able to be self-conscious and self-aware in interactions with others.\n\nThe first appearance of artificial intelligence is in Greek myths, like Talos of Crete or the bronze robot of Hephaestus.

This study of logic produced the idea of a computer in the 19th and 20th century.
